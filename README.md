# 🥥 Coconut Oil as Alternative Transformer Insulation

A research-based web presentation demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of using **coconut oil** as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional **mineral oil** in **power transformers**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores coconut oil's potential as a **biodegradable**, **non-toxic**, and **sustainable** insulating fluid. Our testing covers **physical**, **electrical**, and **chemical** properties, comparing coconut oil directly with traditional transformer oils.

📌 **Key Motivation**:
- Reduce environmental hazards from mineral oil.
- Improve fire safety and biodegradability.
- Introduce sustainable alternatives in electrical engineering.

  ## 💡 Key Findings

| Property             | Coconut Oil        | Mineral Oil      |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Breakdown Strength   | 13-22% higher       | -                |
| Flash Point          | 238°C               | Lower            |
| Fire Point           | 292°C               | Lower            |
| Environmental Impact | Biodegradable       | Non-biodegradable|
